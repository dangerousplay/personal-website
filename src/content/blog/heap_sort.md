The **heap**sort algorithm was designed as a highly efficient and in-place sorting algorithm by **John William Joseph Williams** in the paper "Algorithm 232 - Heapsort", published in **1964** [^1].
The complexity of Heapsort is $O(n \log n)$ in time and $O(1)$ in space.
The algorithm uses the **heap** data structure introduced by **Williams** and can be seen as an improved version of the selection sort [^2].

## The heap data structure

The heap data structure has properties that makes it very suitable to build an efficient sorting algorithm.
**Finding** the largest element in the **heap** is $O(1)$.
**Finding** and **removing** the largest element from the heap takes $O(\log n)$ time.
These properties also make heaps suitable to implement *priority queues*.

The **max** **heap** can be visualized as a *binary tree*, in which each node has two (or less) child nodes, and the value of each node is **greater** than the values of its child nodes.
The **min** variant of the heap has the same structure, but the value of each node is **lesser** than the values of its child nodes.
Due to the value of each node being greater than the value of its children, the **root** node has the **largest** element in the heap or the **smallest** element if it's a min heap.
However, some nodes in the tree can have a different value, for instance, in the level 3 and 4 the nodes can have values which don't follow the rule of being greater between then.


## Heap sorting

Intuitively, the **heapsort** algorithm iteractively swaps the position of the largest element in the heap with the lowest leaf node.

## $\sum_{h=0}^{\log n} { (\frac{n}{2^{h+1}}) } O(h) = O(n \sum_{h=0}^{\log n} { \frac{h}{2^{h}} }) \leq O(n \sum_{h=0}^{\infty} { \frac{h}{2^{h}} }) = O(2n) = O(n)$
